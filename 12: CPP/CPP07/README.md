##### <p align="center"> *As part of my career at school 42, I worked on the Cube 3D project, a fascinating exercise which allowed me to create a 3D game using the MiniLibX graphics engine. This project provided me with a great opportunity to apply my programming skills while exploring the concepts of 3D rendering and game development.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The key notions that I acquired during this project include the manipulation of graphics libraries for 3D rendering. Using MiniLibX, I learned how to create a window, handle keyboard and mouse events, and draw 3D images on the screen. This experience allowed me to understand the basics of 3D rendering, including projecting 3D objects into 2D and managing textures.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *A crucial aspect of Cube 3D was the implementation of raycasting to simulate a first-person view in a maze. I learned how to use raycasting algorithms to calculate distances between the player and the walls, which allowed me to draw the walls with correct perspective. This gave me a working understanding of rendering techniques used in older 3D games.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In addition, I acquired skills in manipulating matrices and vectors. I learned how to use matrix transforms to handle rotations and movements in 3D space, which allowed me to control the camera and in-game objects smoothly and realistically.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The project also taught me the importance of game loop management and continuous updates. I structured my code to handle updates and renders on an ongoing basis, ensuring the game remained responsive and fluid. This experience helped me understand basic concepts of game engines, such as rendering loop and timing management.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In addition, I developed skills in resource management and optimization. Working with 3D graphics and animation presented me with performance challenges, and I learned how to optimize my code to ensure the game ran smoothly, even with limited resources.* </p >

##### <p align="center"> *The Cube 3D project also allowed me to practice modular programming and code structuring. I segmented my program into separate modules for event handling, graphics rendering, and game logic, which improved the readability and maintainability of my code.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Finally, the project made me aware of the importance of rigorous testing and error handling. I created a series of tests to verify that my game worked correctly in various scenarios, including edge cases and error situations. These tests helped me ensure the robustness and reliability of my program.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In summary, the Cube 3D project gave me valuable immersion into game development and 3D rendering. The skills learned during this project, such as manipulating graphics libraries, implementing raycasting, and handling matrix transformations, are essential for any developer interested in developing games or graphics applications. These skills continue to be useful to me in my subsequent projects, where I am often required to design and implement interactive and visually rich systems.* </p>
