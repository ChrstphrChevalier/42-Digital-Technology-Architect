##### <p align="center"> *As part of my career at School 42, I worked on the Minitalk project, a project that allowed me to understand and implement inter-process communication using UNIX signals. This project was an exciting challenge that allowed me to develop essential skills in systems and low-level programming.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The key notions that I acquired during this project include signal management in UNIX. I learned how to use signals to enable communication between a client and a server. In particular, I used the SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals to transmit bits of information, which allowed me to understand how signals can be used to transmit data between processes.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *A crucial aspect of Minitalk was process manipulation and synchronization management. I learned how to manage PIDs (Process IDs) and send signals synchronously to ensure reliable communication between client and server. This helped me develop a deep understanding of how processes interact in a UNIX environment.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In addition, I acquired skills in string manipulation and data conversion. I had to convert characters to bits and vice versa, using bit shift operations and masks. This fine manipulation of data allowed me to strengthen my skills in low-level programming and information processing.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The project also taught me the importance of error handling and code robustness. I had to make sure my program could handle communication errors, such as lost signals or unexpected interruptions. This made me aware of the importance of error handling in developing reliable software.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Additionally, I developed skills in debugging and testing programs. Working with signals and processes presented me with unique challenges, and I learned how to use debugging tools to monitor and analyze the behavior of my programs. I also implemented rigorous testing to ensure that my communications system worked properly under various conditions.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The Minitalk project also allowed me to practice modular programming and code structuring. I segmented my program into separate modules for client and server, which improved the readability and maintainability of my code.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In summary, the Minitalk project allowed me to develop a deep understanding of inter-process communication and signal handling in UNIX. The skills learned during this project are essential for any developer working with UNIX systems, and they continue to serve me well in my subsequent projects, where I am often required to design reliable and efficient communication systems.* </p>
