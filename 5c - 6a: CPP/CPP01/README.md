##### <p align="center"> *The aim of the CPP01 module is to delve deeper into object-oriented programming in C++. This module builds on the foundations established in CPP00 and introduces us to more advanced concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *We learn how to create class hierarchies and leverage kinship relationships to organize and extend our code efficiently. Additionally, we explore concepts such as virtual functions, abstract classes, and interfaces to create flexible and scalable systems.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *This module allows us to strengthen our understanding of OOP and develop more advanced skills in C++, preparing us for more complex challenges in later modules.* </p>
