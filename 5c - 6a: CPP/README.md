###### <p align="center"> *As part of my career at school 42, I had the opportunity to work on a series of C++ modules (called CPP modules), which allowed me to develop an in-depth understanding of object-oriented programming ( OOP) and the particularities of the C++ language. These modules offered me a gradual and complete immersion in advanced C++ concepts, strengthening my software development skills.* </p>

# <p align="center"> ###The key concepts acquired </p>

### <p align="center"> 1/ Modularity and Encapsulation </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Classes and Objects: I learned how to define classes and create objects, encapsulating data and behaviors in logical entities. This allowed me to structure my code in a more organized and maintainable way.* </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Constructors and Destructors: I understood the importance of constructors and destructors for initializing and destroying objects, ensuring proper resource management.* </p>

### <p align="center"> 2/ Inheritance and Polymorphism </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Inheritance: I explored inheritance to reuse and extend the functionality of existing classes, thereby promoting code reusability.* </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Polymorphism: The use of polymorphism, particularly through abstract classes and interfaces, has allowed me to design flexible and scalable systems where objects can be treated uniformly while still allowing specific behaviors.* </p>

### <p align="center"> 3/ Memory Management </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Dynamic Allocation: I learned to manage memory dynamically using the new and delete operators, understanding the implications of manual memory management.* </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Smart Pointers: I explored smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, etc.) for automated memory management, reducing the chances of memory leaks and invalid accesses.* </p>

### <p align="center"> 4/ Overload and Redefinition </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Operator Overloading: I discovered how to overload operators to define specific behaviors for objects, allowing for a more intuitive syntax.* </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Redefinition of Functions: I learned to redefine functions in derived classes to implement specialized behavior, while respecting the interface of the base classes.* </p>


### <p align="center"> 5/ Templates and Generic Programming </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Functions and Classes Templates: I used templates to write generic, reusable code for different data types without duplication, which allowed me to create more flexible and versatile code libraries.* </p>

### <p align="center"> 6/ Exception Management </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Exceptions: I studied exception handling to write more robust code that can handle errors elegantly, using try, catch and throw.* </p>

# <p align="center">     </p>

# <p align="center"> ###Lessons and skills acquired </p>

### <p align="center"> 1/ Object Oriented Design </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- I learned to apply the principles of object-oriented design to create modular and well-structured systems, making code easier to maintain and evolve.* </p>


### <p align="center"> 2/ Abstract Thinking and Modeling </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- The ability to model real-world problems as objects and relationships has allowed me to better understand and solve complex problems.* </p>


### <p align="center"> 3/ Resource Management </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Mastering manual and automatic resource management has made me more aware of the performance and security implications in software development.* </p>


### <p align="center"> 4/ Solving Complex Problems </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- The challenges encountered in each module helped me develop advanced problem-solving and debugging skills, essential for any professional developer.* </p>


### <p align="center"> 5/ Modern C++ Practices </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- Exploring modern C++ features (like smart pointers, lambdas, and new C++ standards) has allowed me to stay up to date with current best practices and techniques in C++ development.* </p>


### <p align="center"> In summary  </p>
###### <p align="center"> *- The CPP modules at School 42 allowed me to develop a deep and practical understanding of C++ and object-oriented programming. The skills learned, such as modularity, resource management, and object-oriented design, are essential for any software developer. These skills continue to be useful to me in my subsequent projects, where I am often required to design and implement robust, efficient and scalable software systems.* </p>
