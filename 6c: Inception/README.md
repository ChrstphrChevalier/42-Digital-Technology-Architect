##### <p align="center"> *As part of my journey at Ã‰cole 42, I participated in the Inception project, a challenge to set up a complete infrastructure with Docker. This project allowed me to dive into the world of containerization, using Docker to automate the deployment of a technical stack composed of several interconnected services.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *During this project, I learned how to create Dockerfiles to configure containers efficiently and to use docker-compose to orchestrate services. I configured and deployed a web server with NGINX, a MariaDB database, and a WordPress CMS, ensuring that each service was isolated while communicating smoothly through a Docker network.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *One of the key skills I developed during this project was managing Docker volumes for data persistence. I learned how to configure volumes to reliably store database data and website files, while ensuring their availability even after a container restart.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *One of the major challenges I faced was managing SSL certificates and setting up a secure connection using NGINX and TLS protocols. This deepened my understanding of security best practices for web deployments.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In addition, the project gave me a better understanding of Docker networks and their role in communicating between different containers. I designed an internal network to connect containers in isolation from the rest of the infrastructure, while configuring ports to allow access to the necessary services.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Finally, this project taught me the importance of error handling and resilience. I implemented automatic restart strategies to ensure the stability of the infrastructure, as well as logging mechanisms to monitor and quickly diagnose problems.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In summary, the Inception project gave me valuable experience in container management, complex infrastructure deployment, and web application security. The skills acquired are essential for working on modern cloud infrastructure and automated deployment projects, and have prepared me to take on new challenges in systems development and administration.* </p>
