##### <p align="center"> *As part of my studies at Ã‰cole 42, I completed the Transcendance project, an immersion in the full-stack development of a modern web application. This project allowed me to acquire practical expertise in the design, development and deployment of an interactive application, while respecting high quality standards in terms of security, performance and ergonomics.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The main objective was to design an online gaming platform with advanced features such as secure authentication, real-time chat and user profile management. This project allowed me to work with key technologies of modern web development, including TypeScript, React for the front-end and NestJS for the back-end, while relying on relational databases such as PostgreSQL.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The Transcendence project was a unique opportunity to combine advanced technical skills with a user-centric approach. It allowed me to master modern full-stack technologies, solve complex problems in real time, and learn about security issues in web applications. These skills are directly applicable to ambitious professional projects requiring innovation and rigor.* </p>
