##### <p align="center"> *As part of my time at School 42, I worked on the Get Next Line project, an exercise that allowed me to develop a function capable of reading a line from a file descriptor efficiently. This project was particularly educational, confronting me with practical challenges linked to input/output management and memory manipulation.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The key concepts that I acquired during this project include buffer management and piecewise reading. I learned how to use functions like read to read blocks of data from a file and how to properly manage the buffer to reconstruct the lines read. This concept of chunked reading helped me understand how to deal with incomplete data and optimize input/output operations.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Another crucial aspect was dynamic memory management. I had to ensure that each line read was correctly allocated in memory and that all allocations were properly freed to avoid memory leaks. This fine-grained memory management is essential for creating robust and efficient programs.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *I also learned how to manipulate strings and pointers in an advanced way. By implementing functions to concatenate strings, find specific characters, and handle line endings, I was able to strengthen my understanding of manipulating text data in C.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The Get Next Line project also taught me the importance of error handling. I had to ensure that my function correctly handled different possible error cases, like invalid reads or incorrect file descriptors, which made me aware of the importance of robustness and resilience in the software development.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Finally, this project allowed me to hone my debugging skills. Working with buffers and pointers often confronted me with subtle errors, which I learned to identify and correct using effective debugging techniques.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In short, the Get Next Line project gave me an in-depth understanding of I/O management, string manipulation and dynamic memory management. These skills are essential for any developer and continue to serve me well in my later projects, where I often need to manage data efficiently and reliably.* </p>
