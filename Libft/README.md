##### <p align="center"> *As part of my career at school 42, I had the opportunity to work on the Libft project, a key step in learning programming in C. This project allowed me to develop my own library of functions, recreating some of the standard functions of the C library, as well as adding other functions useful for manipulating strings and linked lists.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The key concepts I learned during this project include a deep understanding of memory management, including dynamic memory allocation and release, which is essential to avoid memory leaks and segmentation faults. . I also learned how to manipulate pointers precisely, which is crucial for working effectively with data structures in C.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Additionally, I improved my understanding of strings, recreating functions such as strcpy, strcat and strlen. I also designed and implemented functions for manipulating linked lists, which allowed me to strengthen my skills in algorithms and data structuring.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The Libft project taught me the importance of organizing code and documentation. I learned to write clean, well-structured code, as well as how to comment appropriately to make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain. Finally, I realized the importance of unit testing to verify the proper functioning of each function I created, ensuring that they meet the expected specifications.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In short, this project was a real springboard to consolidate my skills in C and taught me to be rigorous and methodical in my way of coding. The lessons learned from Libft continue to serve me in my subsequent projects, helping me approach programming challenges with a structured and effective approach.* </p>
