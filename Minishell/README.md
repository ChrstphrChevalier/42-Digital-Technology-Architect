##### <p align="center"> *As part of my time at School 42, I worked on the Minishell project, a fascinating experiment that allowed me to create a minimalist shell similar to a Unix shell. This project offered me a deep immersion in the fundamental concepts of operating systems, process management, and input/output manipulation.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The key concepts that I acquired during this project include process management. I learned to use the fork, execve, and wait system calls to create and manage child processes, allowing my shell to execute commands concurrently. This experience gave me a practical understanding of how processes are created, managed, and terminated in a Unix system.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *A crucial aspect of the Minishell project was handling I/O and redirections. I learned how to use file descriptors to redirect standard input and output, implementing features like file redirection (>, <) and pipes (|). This allowed me to understand how Unix shells manipulate data flows between processes.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Additionally, I learned signal management skills. I learned how to intercept and handle signals such as SIGINT and SIGQUIT to allow my shell to properly handle interrupts and process terminations. This signal management made me aware of the importance of robustness and resilience in software design.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The project also taught me the importance of parsing and processing strings. I had to implement a parser to interpret commands entered by the user, handling quotes, escapes, and variable expansions. This experience helped me strengthen my skills in string manipulation and parser design.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Additionally, I developed skills in modular design and code structuring. I segmented my shell into several distinct components, such as the process manager, command parser, and I/O handler, which improved the readability, maintainability, and testability of my code.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The Minishell project also made me aware of the importance of rigorous testing and error handling. I created a series of tests to verify that my shell worked correctly in various scenarios, including edge cases and error situations. These tests helped me ensure the robustness and reliability of my program.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In summary, the Minishell project allowed me to develop a deep understanding of process management, I/O, and signals in a Unix environment. The skills learned during this project are essential for any developer working with operating systems or applications requiring fine-grained management of processes and system resources. These skills continue to be useful to me in my later projects, where I am often required to design robust and interactive systems.* </p>
