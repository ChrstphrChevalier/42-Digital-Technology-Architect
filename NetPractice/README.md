##### <p align="center"> *As part of my time at School 42, I worked on the Net Practice project, an enriching experience which allowed me to develop an in-depth understanding of computer networks and communication protocols. This project offered me a unique opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge in a practical context, by confronting myself with real network configuration and troubleshooting situations.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The key notions that I acquired during this project include the fundamental concepts of IP networks. I learned how to configure and manage IP addresses, understand the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6, and manipulate subnetting. This experience allowed me to understand how IP addresses are assigned and used to enable communication between different devices on a network.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Additionally, I learned network troubleshooting skills. The project presented me with various network outage scenarios that I had to diagnose and resolve. This ability to diagnose and resolve network problems is essential to ensuring the reliability and availability of computer networks.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The project also taught me the importance of network security. This security awareness helped me understand the challenges of protecting networks from attacks and intrusions.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In summary, the Net Practice project allowed me to develop an in-depth understanding of computer networks, communications protocols and network equipment management. The skills learned during this project, such as configuring network equipment, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and implementing security measures, are essential for any professional working in the field of networks and IT infrastructure. These skills continue to serve me well in my later projects, where I am often required to design, configure and maintain reliable and secure networks.* </p>
