##### <p align="center"> *As part of my time at School 42, I worked on the Push Swap project, an exciting exercise that allowed me to delve into sorting and stack manipulation algorithms. This project offered me a unique opportunity to improve my algorithmic and optimization skills.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The key concepts that I acquired during this project include the understanding and implementation of different sorting algorithms. I explored simple sorting methods like selection sort, as well as more advanced and optimized techniques adapted to the specific constraints of the project. This helped me develop a solid understanding of the basic principles of sorting algorithms and their performance.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *A key aspect of Push Swap was the manipulation of data structures, particularly stacks. I learned how to implement stacks using linked lists, which strengthened my skills in dynamic memory management and pointer manipulation. I also had to design functions to perform stack operations, such as "push" and "swap", efficiently.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The project also taught me the importance of optimization. To minimize the number of moves needed to sort a stack, I had to analyze and optimize my algorithms, taking into account factors like time and space complexity. This approach made me aware of the importance of efficiency in programming, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *Additionally, I developed debugging and testing skills. Working with sorting algorithms and complex data structures presented me with various challenges, and I learned how to use debugging tools to identify and fix errors in my code. I also implemented rigorous testing to ensure that my algorithms worked correctly in all possible cases, including edge cases.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *The Push Swap project also taught me how to write modular and reusable code. By segmenting my code into well-defined functions and using appropriate data structures, I was able to improve the readability and maintainability of my program. This modular approach is essential for the development of robust and scalable software.* </p>

##### <p align="center"> *In summary, the Push Swap project allowed me to consolidate my skills in algorithms, optimization and manipulation of data structures. The lessons learned from this subsequent project will be useful to me in my subsequent projects, where I am often required to design and implement efficient algorithms to solve complex problems.* </p>
